Phase 2.2b work is implemented and verified in this codebase. I audited all deliverables against the spec and applied small fixes plus QA-friendly tuning. Summary of whatâ€™s in place and what I changed:

Implemented deliverables found in repo
- Config exports present and inspector-visible
  - Repro thresholds and controls are exported in [scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd](scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd:26)
- Identity/genealogy
  - generation, parent_id fields are added and preserved in [scripts/components/IdentityComponent.gd](scripts/components/IdentityComponent.gd:1)
- Biological extensions and death interception
  - Cooldown, should_reproduce(), energy bookkeeping, and intercepted death flow implemented in [BiologicalComponent.should_reproduce()](scripts/components/BiologicalComponent.gd:87) and [BiologicalComponent.apply_reproduction_bookkeeping()](scripts/components/BiologicalComponent.gd:100), with graceful destruction interception in [BiologicalComponent._request_death()](scripts/components/BiologicalComponent.gd:164)
- Global events
  - bacteria_reproduction_started/completed and entity_died are defined in [scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd](scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd:13)
- Temporary behavior controller and states
  - Controller + states exist and are wired:
    - [scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd](scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd:1)
    - [scripts/behaviors/state/State.gd](scripts/behaviors/state/State.gd:1)
    - [scripts/behaviors/state/StateMachine.gd](scripts/behaviors/state/StateMachine.gd:1)
    - [scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateSeeking.gd](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateSeeking.gd:1)
    - [scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateReproducing.gd](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateReproducing.gd:1)
    - [scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateDying.gd](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateDying.gd:1)
  - Reproduction limiting window implemented in [BehaviorController.can_reproduce_now()](scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd:74)
  - Child spawn is clamped to dish using [EntityFactory.create_entity_clamped()](scripts/systems/EntityFactory.gd:128)
- VFX & scene wiring
  - CPUParticles2D FissionBurst present and BehaviorController added in [scenes/entities/Bacteria.tscn](scenes/entities/Bacteria.tscn:24) and [scenes/entities/Bacteria.tscn](scenes/entities/Bacteria.tscn:62)

Polish/fixes applied
- Seeking state visual reset was referencing owner as BaseEntity; corrected to use controller caches (robust for pooled instances)
  - [BacteriaStateSeeking.enter()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateSeeking.gd:9)
- Particle one-shot emission made pooling-safe by deferring the emission flag
  - [BehaviorController.start_fission_burst()](scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd:130)
- Reproducing state forcibly zeros steering each frame to prevent other behaviors from re-accelerating
  - [BacteriaStateReproducing.update()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateReproducing.gd:76)

Fast-test tuning (as requested)
- Config
  - nutrient_target_count set to 200 in [scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd](scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd:12)
  - bacteria_repro_energy_threshold set to 6.0 in [scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd](scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd:27)
  - bacteria_repro_cooldown_sec set to 4.0 in [scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd](scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd:28)
- Event echoing for validation
  - debug_echo_lifecycle enabled in [scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd](scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd:4)
  - Debug handlers are wired in _ready to log reproduction_started, reproduction_completed, and entity_died in [scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd](scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd:22)

Notes on acceptance criteria coverage
- Binary fission with visible pre/post tweens and burst:
  - Pre up-scale and brighten, post restore on parent and child in [BacteriaStateReproducing.enter()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateReproducing.gd:20) and [BacteriaStateReproducing._after_pre_tween()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateReproducing.gd:34)
- Child bounds and registry:
  - Clamped spawn via EntityFactory; nodes are registered and tracked (EntityRegistry usages are consistent)
- Energy cost/split/cooldown tunable:
  - All parameters sourced from ConfigurationManager in [BiologicalComponent.apply_reproduction_bookkeeping()](scripts/components/BiologicalComponent.gd:100)
- Controller coordinates Seeking/Reproducing/Dying and intercepts double-destroy:
  - Death intercepted in [BiologicalComponent._request_death()](scripts/components/BiologicalComponent.gd:174) and routed to [BacteriaStateDying.enter() and _on_tween_finished()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateDying.gd:11)
- Performance/stability: design appears sound; profile at higher counts recommended

How to validate in-editor now
- Launch the game (current scene must include Petri dish and some initial bacteria; if spawning is manual use any spawner you already have).
- Observe logs:
  - reproduction_started and reproduction_completed should print frequently while energy threshold is 6.0 and cooldown 4.0 (GlobalEvents debug echo is on).
- Visual checks:
  - During reproduction, parent briefly scales up and brightens, then child spawns nearby, then both settle size.
  - On death, entity fades and shrinks over 0.3s before destruction.
- Behavior checks:
  - Parent and child should remain inside dish bounds due to [EntityFactory.create_entity_clamped()](scripts/systems/EntityFactory.gd:128)
  - Movement should be paused during reproduction and death due to [BehaviorController.zero_motion()](scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd:108) and state updates.

Revert plan after QA
- Reset values in [scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd](scripts/systems/ConfigurationManager.gd:12):
  - nutrient_target_count back to 20
  - bacteria_repro_energy_threshold back to 10.0
  - bacteria_repro_cooldown_sec back to 8.0
- Disable lifecycle echo in [scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd](scripts/systems/GlobalEvents.gd:4) by setting debug_echo_lifecycle = false

Risks mitigated
- Double destruction: death is intercepted by controller; final destroy happens in [BacteriaStateDying._on_tween_finished()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateDying.gd:34)
- Pooled instance visuals: states reset visuals on enter in [BacteriaStateSeeking.enter()](scripts/behaviors/bacteria/BacteriaStateSeeking.gd:9)
- Particle pooling: safe re-trigger with deferred emit in [BehaviorController.start_fission_burst()](scripts/behaviors/BehaviorController.gd:130)

This completes Phase 2.2b (v2) implementation and integrates fast-test tuning for validation. After QA, revert the test constants as noted above.
